<h2>History of the Royal castle in Kaliningrad</h2>

<p style= "text-align:justify" > <span style= "font-size: 14px" >the Kaliningrad region is the only one in Russia that is separated from our vast country by other States. And when you walk around the city, you can find it a rather strange locality. There are both purely Soviet areas that cause despondency with their grayness, and typical burgher quarters, which are more pleasant to wander through. Kaliningrad is also today a modern Russian port city, but in 1255, when it was founded, the area belonged to Prussia. Then it was decided to form a stronghold for the time of the conquest of the lands, which the crusaders of the Teutonic order did. This point on the map was named Konigsberg, which translates as "Royal mountain" in honor of the Czech king Przemysl II, who granted funds for the construction of the settlement.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:14px"><a href="https://static.koenigs.ru/images/blog/6/id6-005.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://static.koenigs.ru/images/blog/6/id6-005.jpg" style="float:right; height:400px; margin:10px; width:300px" /></a>In the same year, 1255, the castle was founded. It is more accurate to say that the history of the city originates from the moment of formation of this architectural structure. The middle ages in General are very interesting and at the same time terrible time, when the most unexpected events took place. And just then, the fight against the pagans was almost the main goal, a noble act. Therefore, it is not uncommon to hear about the Crusades, which were attended by all those who were waiting for "spiritual salvation". So, returning to the topic: the castle of Konigsberg, at the idea of king Ottokar II and Grand master of the Teutonic order Peppo von Ostern, was erected "to protect the Christian faith".</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:justify" ><span style= "font-size: 14px" >the construction Decision was made in 1254, just after Christmas. By January 17 of the following year, Ottokar II leaves &laquo; generous gifts for the construction of the castle &raquo;, as the chronicler of the order Peter of Duisburg writes. In the spring, work began on the construction of Konigsberg, and, it is worth noting, on a fairly large scale. First, a wooden fortress was built on the site of the previously burned Prussian settlement of Twangeste, which goes into the ground. Next, it was planned to build a stone defensive structure that would occupy the entire spacious plateau of the Royal mountain, located at an altitude of 20 m above the level of the Pregel river. In 1256, the knights of the Teutonic order fenced off the stream, thus obtaining a much-needed Castle pond at that time-from here the moat was replenished. By the way, it was here that the first mill was built.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:justify" ><span style= "font-size: 14px" >in 1260, the Prussian uprising occurred-the largest in history. They destroyed all the Christians they had captured, and also burned many castles, fortresses, and other buildings. A year later, the Prussians reached the Royal castle and besieged it, capturing and destroying the settlement. KÃ¶nigsberg castle by that time had not yet been completed, but it had withstood a two year siege and a fierce battle.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:14px">In the following years, the Royal castle (Kaliningrad) constantly changed, rebuilt, transformed, became larger, more beautiful and stronger. By the XV century, it was already an impregnable and quite powerful fortress, which was a big problem to take. However, after a while, the walls ceased to be a defense against cannons. Gradually, various works of art and valuable books accumulated here. So the castle became the cultural center of the Prussian land.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:justify" > <span style= "font-size: 14px" >in 1525, Konigsberg officially became the residence of the first secular ruler of Prussia, Duke Albrecht. But the master becomes cramped and bored in the faceless chambers of the castle, and he decides on a Grand reconstruction. In the course of this "construction coup", the East wing, later named after the Duke, appears.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:14px">During the Renaissance, the Palace, which had already been transformed, became even more beautiful. The Royal castle (Kaliningrad) was completely completed and became a magnificent residence of the Prussian Dukes from the aesthetic side.</span></p>

<h2>Description of the Royal castle</h2>

<p style= "text-align:justify" ><span style= "font-size:14px" >the Konigsberg Castle had a maximum length of 104 m and a width of 66.8 m. The highest building in the city was the castle tower, which was rebuilt in 64-66 years of the XIX century in the Gothic style.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:justify" ><span style= "font-size: 14px" >This structure has been modified many times over the 7 centuries of its existence. Therefore, it combined all the once fashionable styles: Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and even Rococo. At the same time, its purpose also changed. First it was a defensive structure, then a castle, then fashionable Ducal residences, then a Museum complex, and then a place where spiritual life was concentrated.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:14px">Another interesting thing is the components that make up the Royal castle (Kaliningrad):</span></p>

<h2>Royal castle of Konigsberg today</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:14px">Today, on the site of the Royal castle of Konigsberg there is an observation deck of its ruins and the house of Soviets. Among German tourists, this house of Soviets is called the "new Konigsberg castle".</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:justify" ><span style="font-size: 14px" >to the Left of the entrance to the observation deck of the Royal castle, you can see a memorial plate to Immanuel Kant.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:justify" ><span style= font-size: 14px" >the observation deck of Konigsberg castle is a mountain of stones, each of which has a sign indicating which part of the castle these stones and debris were.</span></p>

<h2>Underground: the story of a legend</h2>

    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:14px">Why did this legend arise? If you analyze the life of the post-war city, you can see that it was mainly inhabited by people from rural areas. How did they see Konigsberg? Numerous FORTS, bunkers, bomb shelters, tunnels & hellip; Naturally, the layman's imagination painted a picture that this is part of some invisible infrastructure. For them, ordinary hatches were an unusual structure.</span></p>

    <p style= "text-align:justify" ><span style= "font-size: 14px" >in Addition, works dedicated to the Amber room, which were published in the 50s, are of great interest. This is the Secret of the Amber room, the Secret fairway, and many others.</span></p>

    <h2>General Lyash's Bunker and the Amber room</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:14px"><a href="https://static.koenigs.ru/images/blog/6/id6-014.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="https://static.koenigs.ru/images/blog/6/id6-014.jpg" style="float:right; height:300px; margin:10px; width:438px" /></a>The history of the masterpiece called the Amber room is still shrouded in many secrets. First, why it had to be evacuated along with all the decorations of the palaces? Second, according to the NKVD, two copies of the room were made, and the original was sent as a gift to the United States. One copy was immured in the cellars of the Catherine Palace, and the second was placed in the place of the original. The Germans took it.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:14px">According to researchers, the masterpiece may be located in the bunker of Lyash, the city's commandant. The structure was built in 1944. Historians say that this underground structure is very large, it has at least two floors and an extensive system of corridors and secret rooms. This is where the Amber room is hidden, as well as a large number of bars of melted gold.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:justify" ><span style="font-size: 14px">in addition, scientists hope to find research materials from the Nazi laboratory "Konigsberg-13" in the bunker. It is known that Hitler and his associates developed "weapons of retribution". It could also be here.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:justify" > <span style="font-size: 14px">research Results and other trophies were hoped to get not only Soviet intelligence, but also the allies. That is why there were fierce discussions about who should enter the city first.</span></p>

<h2>Death of the Royal castle</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:14px">Founded by the Czech king, the structure lasted until 1968. The first destruction of the castle was during the Second world war. The aerial bombardment caused major damage to the structure, but, oddly enough, it still retained its beautiful and slightly menacing appearance. In addition, it could be restored. But as time went on, there was no further discussion. Many people were against the restoration of Konigsberg. No wonder in 1945 in the newspaper "truth"; the castle was named "rotten tooth in the mouth of a fascist Viper". It caused unpleasant emotions in people, and it took a lot of money to restore it. It is not known how long this architectural structure would have stood in the dark, if not for Kosygin. In the late 60s of the last century, when the question "what are these ruins in the city center" was answered that they were going to make a local history Museum here, Kosygin was indignant: "Open a Museum to Prussian militarism? Demolish it immediately!"so the fate of Koenigsberg was decided. Although there is no evidence that this was really the case.</span></p>
